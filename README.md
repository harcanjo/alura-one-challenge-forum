# Alura - Oracle - Challenge ONE: Spring Framework: FÃ³rum Hub

## Challenge Description

> History

Welcome to our latest Challenge Back End challenge!

A forum is a space where all participants on a platform can ask their questions about certain topics. Here at Alura, students use the forum to ask questions about the courses and projects in which they are participating. This magical place is full of lots of learning and collaboration between students, teachers and moderators.

We already know what the forum is for and we know what it looks like, but do we know how it works behind the scenes? That is, where is the information stored? How is the data processed to relate a topic to an answer, or how do users relate to the answers to a topic?

This is our challenge, called ForumHub: in it, we will replicate this process at the back end level and, for this, we will create a REST API using Spring.

Our API will focus specifically on topics, and should allow users to:

- Create a new topic;
- Show all created topics;
- Show a specific topic;
- Update a topic;
- Delete a topic.

This is what we normally know as CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)* and it is very similar to what we developed in LiterAlura, but now in a complete way, adding the UPDATE and DELETE operations, and using a framework that will make it much easier. our work.

*Free translation (in order): Create, Consult, Update and Delete.

In summary, our objective with this challenge is to implement a REST API with the following functionalities:

1. API with routes implemented following the best practices of the REST model;
2. Validations carried out according to business rules;
3. Implementation of a relational database for information persistence;
4. Authentication/authorization service to restrict access to information.

> Development details.

The API entities were developed following the challenge description an business logic.

The Database scheme is described in the image below.
